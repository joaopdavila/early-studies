# Exercise 16: Calculate the cube of all numbers from 1 
# to a given number
# Write a program to rint the cube of all numbers from 1 
# to a given number

# Given:

# input_number = 6

# Expected output:

# Current Number is : 1  and the cube is 1
# Current Number is : 2  and the cube is 8
# Current Number is : 3  and the cube is 27
# Current Number is : 4  and the cube is 64
# Current Number is : 5  and the cube is 125
# Current Number is : 6  and the cube is 216

n = int(input("Enter number: "))

for i in range(n):
    i += 1
    print('Current Number is: %d  and the cube is %d' % (i,i*i*i))
